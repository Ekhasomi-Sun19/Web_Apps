# Overview

# Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.
One thing I'm trying to accomplish as a software engineer is to be able to make useful impact in the field of technology, being able to create web applicaton and or useful
software that will make daily task easy for end users concern. In order to be able to accomplish this, learning specific languages for different task function
is very much important in my career part. You cannot talk to a software engineer without asking about their programming, logical, and technical problem solving skills.

# Provide a description of your software

For the sake of this assignment, I wrote a Web Application for a simple calculator. This Calculator is design using HTML, a simple Javascript, and CSS program. HTML is used to design the framework, more like the skeleton, CSS was used for styling and good visual view, while Javascript was used to mostly for the logical aspect of the calculator. This takes user input, perform basic calculations and output result.

- Web App (Calculator)
- Network, either peer-peer or client to server
- Cloud Database
- Language - Kotlin: Part of my project will involve the use of Kotlin language
- Mobile App

# Describe your purpose for creating this software.

I have always wanted to build a web application, and doing this simple project is more like me getting started. I have done web 
development in simple fashion, but I wish to go more indebt into it, thus my purpose for creating this program.

## Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.

This will be provided as the program is completed and running.

# Development Environment
for the development environment, I used Visual Studio Code as my editor.
# Describe the tools that you used to develop the software

For this Web Application Calculator I used the following program
HTML was used as a framework in and text editor
JAVASCRIPT was used to perform basic logical operation for the calculator to evaluate it's operations
and CSS, was used for visual display.

The google chrome developer platform was also a very important tool that I used for this project to determine various screen size and resolution. 

Github was also a tool for cloud storage of my code, and I used it to create an actual web link that can be use to easily access the program online. The below link will actually open the program on a web browser.



# Describe the programming language that you used
